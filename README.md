# State Estimation Using Particle Filter

<!--We saw in class that the Particle Filter provides a simple yet highly versatile algorithm for performing
recursive Bayesian estimation, and is especially well-suited to state estimation problems
with nonlinear state transition or measurement functions or non-Gaussian models of uncertainty.
In this exercise, you will apply particle ltering to perform state estimation over a Lie group:
specically, you will design and implement a particle lter to track the pose of a dierential-drive
ground robot.-->
